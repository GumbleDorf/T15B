Makefile:

end program: tw
components: tw.o, Dict.o stemmer.o

If either *.o files not found, go to the components in the makefile and individually make the .o file

3.

For every #include statement, it is included that many times

#ifndef X   ----  If X is not defined
#define X    -------- Once it is included once, it is defined
Include this
#endif

Way of ensuring we only include one coyp of the .h file.

Left rotate:

take right child X, take right child's left subtree Y 

Make Node X the new root, right subtree of old root becomes Y
Left subtree of X becomes the old root

Right rotate:

Flipped

Output orderings:

L = Left subtree
D = Root Node
R = right subtree

Infix: L D R

Prefix: D L R

Postfix: L R D

Level: Each level of the tree left to right

What kind of trees have the property that their infix output is the same as their prefix output?

Linear trees (right degenerate tree = ordered linked list)

Root
    \
    Node
        \
        Node
    
One node trees
