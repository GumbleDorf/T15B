Provide huffman encoding for

ababbcdcbaabcacbbbs

a: 5
b: 8
c: 4
d: 1
s: 1

Encode into a tree:


		O
	       / \
	      O   b
	     / \
	    O	a    
	   / \
	  c   O
	     / \
	    d   s
	     
	     
When we traverse the tree we translate the children into 1 or 0 depending on if the are left children or right children. Example:

a encodes as 01
b encodes as 1
c encodes as 000
d encodes as 0010
s encodes as 0011

Idea is to compress each character down into a very small series of bytes (as opposed to 8 bit length of an ASCII character)
